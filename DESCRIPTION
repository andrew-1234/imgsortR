Title: Sort Directory of Images from Dall-E 2 into Folders Based on Keywords
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Andrew Schwenke
Maintainer: The package maintainer <andrew.schwenke@gmail.com>
Description: This package works based on the assumption that your Dall E 2
    images have prompt text as the file name. It then extracts a keyword list,
    and attempts to sort your images into new (or existing) folders based on the
    keywords. Sorting happens from the highest frequency keyword to the lowest
    frequency. This means that an image can be sorted only into one folder,
    being the highest frequency keyword that has a match in the file name.
